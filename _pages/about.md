I am currently pursuing a PhD on the topic of "Uncertainty Quantification for medical image segmentation" at [Pixyl](https://pixyl.ai/) and [Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/) (GIN). I am supervised by [Michel Dojat](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/annuaire/m-michel-dojat-621497.kjsp) (INSERM), [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) (INRIA, STATIFY) and [Senan Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/senandoyle/) (Pixyl). My work focuses on Uncertainty Quantification techniques in order to increase the robustness and reliability of the automated segmentation models. My research is divided in several areas:
