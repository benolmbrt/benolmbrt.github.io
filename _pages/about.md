I am an AI researcher specialized in medical image processing. I recently completed my PhD on the topic of _**Uncertainty Quantification for medical image segmentation**_ at [Pixyl](https://pixyl.ai/) and [Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/) (GIN). I was supervised by [Michel Dojat](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/annuaire/m-michel-dojat-621497.kjsp) (INSERM), [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) (INRIA, STATIFY) and [Senan Doyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/senandoyle/) (Pixyl). 

My work focuses on Uncertainty Quantification techniques in order to increase the robustness and reliability of automated segmentation models. My research is divided in several areas: 

- Probability calibration 
- Quantifying uncertainty at the pixel (or voxel)-level: Ensembling techniques, heteroscedastic models
- Structural uncertainty: identifying uncertain structures (e.g lesions, tumors) in the segmentation
- Out-of-distribution detection, particularly from the latent space of trained models
- Predictive intervals using Conformal Prediction
- Risk control for medical image segmentation

As side projects, I also worked on the following topics:
- Unsupervised Anomaly Detection using reconstruction Autoencoders
- White Matter Hyperintensities synthesis using 3D Diffusion models

Short bio
======

I obtained a Biomedical engineering degree at [Télécom Physique Strasbourg](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/en/school/about-us/) in 2020, along with a [Master IRIV](https://www.master-iriv.fr/) (Imagery, Robotics, Engineering for the Living) from the University of Strasbourg. I then joined Pixyl in 2020, first as a Research engineer, then as PhD student starting May 2021. 

News
======
- August 2023: Our 2 papers have been accepted to MICCAI 2023 Unsure Workshop, respectively on the topic of [Out-of-Distribution detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15647) and [Predictive Intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15638).
- May 2023: We made it to the 2nd position of the [SHIFT challenge medical track](https://shifts.grand-challenge.org/) !
